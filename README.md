# Sinegularity — A Marketplace for Student Innovation

**Role:** Lead Product Designer & Co-Founder  
**The Mission:** Bridge the "Co-founder Gap" at UCD by connecting technical engineers with creative business minds.

## 📐 Design Challenge: The "Co-founder Discovery" Problem
Students often have "Startup FOMO"—they have skills but no ideas, or ideas but no technical partner. I designed Sinegularity to act as the "missing piece," focusing on three key pillars: **Discovery, Credibility, and Connection.**

## 🛠️ Key Design Features

### 1. The "Latest Sines" Feed (Information Design)
I designed a card-based feed to make projects scannable. 
* **Taxonomy:** Categorized posts by "Engineering," "CS," and "Tech" tags to allow users to filter by their expertise instantly.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Prioritized the project title and a short "hook" to reduce cognitive load while browsing multiple ideas.

### 2. Trust & Social Proof (Endorsements & About)
To move students from "browsing" to "messaging," trust is essential. 
* **Endorsements:** Integrated a dedicated section for external validation (NovaUCD) to boost platform authority.
* **FAQ Architecture:** Designed an accordion-style FAQ to answer common barriers to entry (Cost, Purpose, Job Potential) without cluttering the landing page.

### 3. Responsive CTA Strategy
The "Get Started" and "Check Out More" buttons are strategically placed at the top and bottom of the "Sines" feed to ensure a clear **Conversion Path** regardless of where the user is on the page.

## 🎨 Visual Identity
* **Modern Professionalism:** Used a clean, high-contrast layout to appeal to both serious student founders and university stakeholders (NovaUCD).
* **Accessibility:** Focused on a legible typographic scale to ensure the "Smart Glimpse" and "Power Steered" project descriptions are readable on small mobile screens.

## 🚀 Impact & Growth
* **Unified the UCD Startup Ecosystem:** Transitioned from a simple society page to a functional networking tool for UCD ElecSoc and NovaUCD.
* **Scalable Framework:** Built the frontend to be "Idea Agnostic"—allowing any student to post regardless of their technical level.
