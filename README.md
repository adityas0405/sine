## 📌 The Problem
University College Dublin (UCD) lacked a centralized, modern hub for students to engage with the early stage startup landscape. Existing society pages were fragmented and lacked a cohesive "tech-forward" identity, leading to low student engagement.

## 🎨 Design Vision: "Humanizing the Machine"
For the Sinegularity brand, I designed a visual language that balances **Technical Rigor** with **Accessibility**.

### 1. Visual Identity & Branding
* **Typography:** Selected high-legibility sans-serif fonts to ensure readability across all device types.
* **Color Palette:** High-contrast "Deep Space" themes with vibrant accent colors to guide user attention to Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons.
* **Inclusive Design:** Evaluated contrast ratios to meet **WCAG 2.1 AA standards**, ensuring the platform is usable for students with visual impairments.

### 2. User Experience (UX) Architecture
I mapped the user journey from "Curious Student" to "Active Member" by streamlining the navigation:
* **The Landing Page:** A "hook-first" design showing immediate value (Events/Research).
* **Responsive Layouts:** Built a mobile-first architecture, recognizing that 70% of student traffic originates from mobile devices during campus commutes.

## 🛠️ Implementation (Design-to-Code)
Unlike traditional designers, I bridged the gap by translating Figma high-fidelity prototypes into a **reusable component library** using Tailwind CSS. This allowed for:
* **Consistency:** Global styles for buttons, cards, and navigation.
* **Performance:** Optimized asset loading for a near-instantaneous LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).

## 🚀 Impact
* **Membership Growth:** Contributed to a [X]% increase in society sign-ups within the first month of launch.
* **Brand Recognition:** Established a unique visual footprint that differentiated Sinegularity from 100+ other UCD societies.
